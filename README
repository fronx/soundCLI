INTRODUCTION
  This is a command line client for streaming music from soundcloud. Timed
  comments are displayed on the command line as the playback reaches their
  respective positions.

EXAMPLES
  Stream 'The Human Song' from soundcloud:
  ./soundcli.rb stream http://soundcloud.com/rekado/the-human-song

	Play the local file 'faded.ogg' and display timed comments for the same song
	on soundcloud:
	./soundcli.rb play faded.ogg http://soundcloud.com/rekado/faded

SETUP
  soundCLI will save your authentication/refresh tokens (not your credentials)
  in a file, so you only need to provide your credentials once. The token file
  will be saved to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/soundcli.

  mkdir ~/.config/soundcli

DEPENDENCIES
  - gstreamer bindings for ruby (gst)
  - cURL bindings for ruby (curb)
	- the JSON gem (json)

BUGS
  - download only returns the download url but does not download yet

TROUBLESHOOTING
  Q: I get a weird error message when attempting to stream a file:
     No URI handler implemented for "http"
     gsturidecodebin.c(1065): gen_source_element (): /GstPlayBin2:playbin20/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0

	A: You are probably missing some gstreamer plugins. Install a bunch of them
     through your package management system and see if the error disappears.

  Q: When attempting to run soundCLI I get an error:
     no such file to load -- json/gst/curb in ...

  A: You need to install the gems listed in the section DEPENDENCIES
